<p id="tribute-info">The squat is considered by many to be the ultimate test of strength, technique and will.<p>It also serves as a reassuring metaphor for life, having a heavy load placed upon your shoulders and finding the strength to push through it no matter how hard it may be when you hit bottom. Great for quadriceps hypertrophy. 
<p>Unfortunately, the squat has recieved some backlash due to the ill concieved notion that it is inherently bad for your knees. It is not.
